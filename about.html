<h2>about the project</h2>
<p> i had used html,css,sql and php in my project.</p>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<p> The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed 
    in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

  <p>  Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
     the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
    
  <p>  HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the
     rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural 
    semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.</p>
    <p> HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img>  
    directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as  surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags,
    but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
    
  <p>  HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language 
    such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former
     maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>
<h3>CSS</h3>
<p> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</p>
  <p>  CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</p>
  <p>  CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</p>
  <p>  External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</p>

<h3> PHP  </h3>

<p>PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.
    <p> The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.</p>

<p>   PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would
     form the whole or part of an HTTP response.</p>
    <p>  Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control.</p>
     <p> PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.</p>
    
  <p>  The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web
       servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.</p>
<h3>SQL</h3>
<p>SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data,
     i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables.

   </p><p> SQL offers two main advantages over older read–write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or without an index.
    
    <p>Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types of statements, which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: a data query language (DQL),[a] a data definition language (DDL),[b] a data control language (DCL), 
        and a data manipulation language (DML).</p>
<p>    The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), 
    and data access control. Although SQL is essentially a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.
    
   </p><p> SQL was one of the first commercial languages to use Edgar F. Codd’s relational model. 
       The model was described in his influential 1970 paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks". Despite not entirely adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, it became the most widely used database language.
    
    </p><p>SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. Since then, the standard has been revised 
        to include a larger set of features. Despite the existence of standards, most SQL code requires at least some changes before being ported to different database systems.</p>
